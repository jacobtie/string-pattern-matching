This is a test file to find a particular word using a pattern-matching algorithm. 
We have implemented three of the five options for pattern-matching algorithms that we 
have learned so far. If they work correctly, then they should return the locations of 
the word where it is found in the text. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, 
but all algorithms should be able to locate a word or phrase without fail.
